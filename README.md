üß† AWS Free-Tier & Resource Cleanup Lambda
Overview

The AWS Daily Resource Cleanup Lambda automatically scans your AWS account once per day to:

Detect and terminate idle or unused services

Check if active resources have exceeded free-tier limits

Identify costly VPC components (NAT Gateways, Load Balancers, Endpoints, VPNs)

Optionally send a summary report to your email via Amazon SNS

This helps reduce unnecessary AWS spending and keep your account clean and cost-efficient.

üß∞ Features
Category	Checks / Actions
EC2	Terminates stopped instances; estimates total instance-hours vs free-tier (750 hrs)
EBS	Deletes unattached EBS volumes
Elastic IPs	Releases unassociated Elastic IPs
S3	Deletes empty buckets; checks total size vs 5 GB free-tier
Lambda	Monitors monthly invocations (1 M free)
RDS	Checks active instance hours vs 750 hrs free-tier
VPC Resources	Detects active NAT Gateways, Load Balancers, Endpoints, VPNs
Notifications	Sends daily summary to SNS/email (optional)
‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Lambda Function

Go to AWS Lambda ‚Üí Create function

Choose:

Runtime: Python 3.12.3

Architecture: x86_64

Copy and paste the Lambda code
 into the function editor

Set the Timeout to 5 minutes

2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure IAM Role

Attach a custom role or inline policy with the following permissions:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {"Effect": "Allow", "Action": [
      "ec2:*",
      "s3:*",
      "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
      "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
      "lambda:ListFunctions",
      "sns:Publish",
      "logs:*",
      "elasticloadbalancing:*"
    ], "Resource": "*"}
  ]
}


‚ö†Ô∏è You may narrow these permissions to Describe*, List*, Delete*, and TerminateInstances for stricter security.

3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Configure SNS Notifications

Create an SNS topic (e.g., aws-cleanup-daily-report)

Subscribe to your email address to it

Add the topic ARN to the Lambda‚Äôs environment variables:

Key	Value
SNS_TOPIC_ARN	arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:aws-cleanup-daily-report
4Ô∏è‚É£ Schedule Daily Execution

Create an EventBridge Rule:

Schedule expression:

cron(0 0 * * ? *)   # Runs daily at midnight UTC


Target: the Lambda function you just created

üßæ Outputs

CloudWatch Logs: All actions and findings are logged.

SNS Email (optional): A daily summary like:

‚úÖ Terminated stopped EC2 instances: ['i-0abcd1234']
‚úÖ Deleted unattached EBS volumes: ['vol-07efgh5678']
‚ö†Ô∏è Found 2 active NAT Gateways (each ~$0.045/hr)
‚ö†Ô∏è Lambda usage exceeded free-tier: 1,250,000 invocations

üß© Optional: Dry Run Mode

To preview what the script would delete, set:

DRY_RUN = True


This will log actions only, without deleting or terminating any resources.

üí∞ Cost Impact Overview
Service	Free Tier	Action
EC2	750 hrs/month	Terminates stopped instances
S3	5 GB storage	Deletes empty buckets
Lambda	1M invocations/month	Logs usage warning
RDS	750 hrs/month: Checks usage
VPC Components	Pay-per-hour	Flags NAT, VPNs, Endpoints, ELBs
üß† Future Enhancements

 Add AWS Cost Explorer API integration for cost breakdowns

 Include DynamoDB & CloudFront usage

 Add Slack or Teams webhook integration

 Store daily reports in S3 for cost trend tracking
